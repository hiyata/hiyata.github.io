## About Me

I am a researcher specializing in the intersection of machine learning and virology. My work primarily focuses on developing computational techniques to model virus behavior and their molecular interactions. 

By applying machine learning algorithms to vast datasets of viral genomes and epidemiological information, I aim to uncover patterns and insights that can lead to better predictive models and innovative solutions in virology. 

My research involves developing and refining machine learning models to analyze and predict viral mutations, transmission patterns, and host-virus interactions. This includes working with deep learning architectures, clustering algorithms, and generative models to simulate viral evolution and identify potential therapeutic targets. I am passionate about using cutting-edge technology to contribute to the global effort in understanding and combating viral diseases, ultimately aiming to improve public health outcomes and preparedness for future outbreaks.
