Viruses are obligate, intracellular parasites and are most known for their role pathogenesis. Viruses come in many flavors, from DNA to RNA, single stranded or double stranded, and circular or linear. They are thought to have been some of the first life-forms to evolve on Earth and drivers of evolution in other forms of life. 

Some viruses have evolved adjacently with their hosts for millions of years, such as human cytomegalovirus. The result of this coexistance are highly specialized viruses tailored to thrive in human hosts without causing pathogenesis.
