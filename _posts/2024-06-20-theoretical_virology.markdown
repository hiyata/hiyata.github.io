## Theoretical Virology and Artificial Intelligence

Viruses are obligate, intracellular parasites and are most known for their role in pathogenesis. Viruses come in many flavors, from DNA to RNA, single-stranded or double-stranded, and circular or linear. They are thought to have been some of the first life-forms to evolve on Earth and drivers of evolution in other forms of life. 

Some viruses have evolved adjacently with their hosts for millions of years, such as human cytomegalovirus. The result of this coexistence is highly specialized viruses tailored to thrive in human hosts without causing pathogenesis.
